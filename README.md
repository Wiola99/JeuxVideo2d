Once the user has made a selection of the place, he or she will have to help the friendly creature named Alvin to travel through the country. The user can help Alvin by answering the questions about culture, food, language and more. 
The game provides information about the most visited places in a country, gives some essential words to memorise and presents with elements of the culture like clothing andlegends or history and cuisine. 
For every good answet the user scores points. 


__The game is aimed to people who like travels and would like to get in a fun way basic information about a country they want to travel to, or to those who would like to check their knowledge about the specific place.__


Further developpment of the game would include vaste choice of countries and specific places to discover with up to date information. The user would be able to freely choose their destination, change it and come back to the unvisited places.
